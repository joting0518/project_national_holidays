class gundam(object):
    def __init__(self, driver):
        self.driver = driver

# easy to access

class gundam(object):
    def __init__(self, driver):
        self._driver = driver

# private but cannot access

class gundam(object):
    def __init__(self, driver):
        self._driver = driver
    def get_driver(self):
        return self._driver
    def set_driver(self, new_driver):
        self._driver = new_driver

# add getter and setter

class gundam(object):
    def __init__(self, driver):
        self._driver = driver
    @property
    def driver(self):
        return self._driver
    def set_driver(self, new_driver):
        self._driver = new_driver

# easy to get, just as public attribute

class gundam(object):
    def __init__(self, driver=None):
        self.driver = driver
    @property
    def driver(self):
        print('get driver')
        return self._driver
    @driver.setter
    def driver(self, new_driver):
        print('set driver')
        self._driver = new_driver

# when initialize, call setter at the same time
